# Daily.dev UI Clone

Hi! This is my first time making UI look from header to footer with ReactJS.  
In this project, I use ReactJS to structure content and SCSS + BEM method to style elements.  
  
To be frankly, I still don't know much about ReactJS, its best practices, how to effectively use styles, and how to organize project files and folders. I'm still learning React basics and how to work with components, so you may see that the codes and everything are still not perfect, but I promise I will make some progress in a few days and come up with new hands-on projects to hone my ReactJS skill :)  
  
Anyway, I'm quite happy with what I did with this project! On my devices, it looks nice and neat enough. If you found any issues or you want to give me some advice regarding this work, please please do tell me because I love to learn and I'm so excited with ReactJS! :)
